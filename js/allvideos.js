They use elements such as icons, symbols, and forms, in spatial arrays to convey rich meanings. They put ideas into the world, relieving cognitive load, structuring thought, and externalizing it for contemplation by individuals and groups in the service of inference, innovation, and collaboration. A broad range of examples, both historical and empirical, will show the many ways that external graphic representations reflect and affect thought.\n","bio":"Barbara Tversky is Professor of Psychology and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University.

There are well-established rules that tell us how to show the data, what to show, what to leave out, etc. These rules are based on some sound research, so following them is generally a good idea.\n\nWhen it comes to communicating with data, however, things are different. The goals are no longer as clearly defined, and they differ considerably from the analytical and precise ones in the other tasks. Now we are after more high-level concepts like memory, engagement, and understanding. As a result, the approach needs to change. We can’t just assume that the same rules apply that served us when the goal is to precisely read the data.\n\nTelling stories with data is exciting because it opens up an entire new direction for research and creative work. The goal of this talk will be to tease apart the different goals, rules, and approaches, and to argue for a deeper understanding of what makes each of them different and unique.\n","bio":"Robert Kosara is a research scientist at Tableau Software.

From journalists working in newspapers, to scientists in need to effectively communicate their scientific results, everyone seems to be interested in using this tool to boost their communication powers. Visualization however can both enlighten and obfuscate, empower and mislead, depending on how it is designed. For this reason it is crucial to (1) better understand under what circumstances it leads to positive rather than negative outcomes and (2) generate didactic material and processes for people to learn how to read visualization, to avoid being deceived, and how to design and develop visualizations to communicate effectively. In this talk I'll present some of the research developed in my lab at NYU aimed at solving some of the aforementioned problem. For instance, I will talk about our studies on whether visualization can lead to more persuasive messages and to major deceptions. I will also provide an historical perspective on visualization research and what I think needs to be done to further advance its state of the art.\n","bio":"Enrico Bertini is Assistant Professor at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

Recent developments in the field of indoor positioning systems make the acquisition and availability of visitor behavior data more attainable. However, the analysis of such data remains a challenge due to its noisiness, complexity and sheer size. The current talk describes the design and implementation of a visual system aimed at helping museum curators and personnel to better understand and analyze visitor behavior in their museum. We start by performing an analysis of the curators’ information needs, and accordingly we design visualizations that are based on the acquired data and address curators’ needs. Finally, we evaluated our design decisions by conducting an expert study with museum curators.","bio":"Joel Lanir is a lecturer and faculty member at the University of Haifa's Information System department.

In this talk I shall define visualisation comprehension basing on two relatively recent accounts of perception: Principles of Perceptual Organisation and the Reverse Hierarchy Theory. The resulting account enables evaluation that is not only objective, but also non-comparative, providing an absolute efficiency classification.

Some of the open issues are actually rather basic, for example, how to figure out what the collection is all about, that is, how to create a holistic view on the collection. Typical solutions are search (that provides a narrow visibility at the collection from the point of view of a query), and classification / clustering of the entire collection (which is either too coarse or not accurate enough).\nWe view a document collection as a graph where nodes are documents and edges are semantic similarities between the documents. While this representation is by no means novel, its construction is extremely challenging as it involves examining many trillions of document pairs. We employ existing Big Data technologies to overcome this challenge. The graph representation allows exploration of any topical region of the collection, as well as zooming in or out to evaluate density / analyze topology of various regions. Our approach does not solve the fundamental problem as the holistic view on the entire collection is still unachievable, however it provides visualization and exploration capabilities that cannot be obtained elsewhere. On an example of a collection of all patents issued in the US over the last 39 years, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach, and overview a variety of visualization schema.”\n","bio":"Ron Bekkerman is a Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Management, the University of Haifa.

Visualizations are typically designed based on the data to be displayed and the tasks to be supported, but they follow a one size-fits-all approach when it comes to user individual differences such as expertise, cognitive abilities, states and preferences. There is, however, mounting evidence that these user characteristics can significantly influence user experience during information visualization tasks. These findings have triggered research on user-adaptive visualizations, i.e.,,visualizations that can track and adapt to relevant user characteristics and specific needs. \nIn this talk, I will present results on which user individual differences can impact visualization processing and on how these differences can be captured using predictive models based on eye-tracking data. I will also discuss how to leverage these models to provide personalized support that can improve the user's experience with a visualization\n","bio":"Cristina Conati received a M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of Milan, as well as a M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Intelligent Systems at the University of Pittsburgh.

When it moved to other media, questions began to arise with how to describe the future: is the future a \"wibbly wobbly timey wimey thing\" or an unfolding of predetermined or \"fated\" events? Science fiction exists which takes either side, imagining the future both as something malleable and something set in stone, depending on the author and their politics. \nWhen it hit cinema and television, science fiction was suddenly faced with the question: \"how do these things look?\". From ships, through weapons and food, creators of science fiction suddenly had to become designers, industrial, informational, aesthetic or otherwise. As a data set, the future also requires visual representation, especially in visible media. When describing the future, how should our graphs look? Should we even use graphs? Can we not use images, probability clouds and other design tools to display the future? \nAs quickly as these questions were asked, they were answered by the timeline. Timelines as the ultimate representation of the future and, indeed, time itself, are everywhere in science fiction. From simple, linear timelines to intricate affairs with dozens of branches, the timeline has become THE method of describing the future, whether in the context of time travel, changing the future or simply dealing with the fact that the future exists, ever present and always ahead of us. \nWhat does that tell us? How does such representation change the way we think about the future within science fiction? Does it limit or broaden our ability to change what's coming? Finally, is it really the optimal way with which to display such a dynamic and varied body of data as the future? My talk will attempt to review the usages of timelines within science fiction and popular culture, all the while examining the presuppositions and politics of choosing such as a tool as the predominant way of representing the future.\n","bio":"Eden Kupermintz is 30 and currently calls Tel Aviv, Israel home.

Targets can vary, one of which can be ‘stealing’ credentials and the identity of a high privilege account (= “sensitive” account).\n\nIn the cyber security world, thus, the end goal is to predict and protect from such threats and breaches within organizational networks. Verbally explaining how attackers move through networks clutters instant understanding and not always proves beneficial due to the volume of data and processes in the computer realm. Moreover, in the cyber security world “every second counts” especially when a real attack takes place. The end result in the UI must follow known UX/UI patterns and provide the end user sufficient and understandable output to act upon the displayed.\nThese and more make the medium of conveying the messaging in the product highly crucial. With all this in mind, we developed the ‘Lateral Movement Paths’ graph in the product, as part of the effort to layout the paths the attacker can potentially follow in order to reach a “sensitive” account. The flow graph breaks down the lateral movement paths to (1) individual paths that consist of (2) step by step components which lead to one of the sensitive accounts in the organization.\nThe development process had its challenges, since the graph component has to withstand both contextual and functional variations, such as changing amounts of paths and steps, different screen resolutions and sizes etc. And even before that, the decision-making phase of the feature definition had to take into consideration the highlighted components and steps from which each path would consist.\nCurrent result is a successful visual display of the potential lateral movement paths with the described challenges in mind and a novelty in terms of lay-outing the attackers’ movement in a coherent and visually straightforward way.\n","bio":"Anna Tsiganchuk, Product Designer and a User Experience thinker for complex systems for the last seven years.

Not simply because data is the material of the digital medium, but because the nature of games themselves is that they are systems of data, and every action taken within them is essentially a manipulation of data. \nThroughout the history of pre-digital games, visual representations have been relatively close in fidelity to the amount of data and relations in the game system: maintaining a degree of abstraction relatively close to the degree by which the game simulation is an abstraction of reality itself (or the fictional reality the game depicts). \nWith the rise of computer graphics, the gap between game visuals and game systems began growing. In the last 4 decades, for a variety of cultural and technological reasons, game systems have not evolved as much as game graphics did. A mimetic desire, similar to that of the Realist movement in 19th art, have taken over games, and “Realistic” graphics are now pervasive in big-budget 3D videogames. But while this graphics culture seems more realistic in its relations to actual reality, it is excessive in relations to the systemic data it represents. \nSince “realistic” graphics are essentially a layer of fiction on top of the real data, bridging the gap between the player’s perception of the game reality and the systemic reality as it is calls for the use of metaphor. \nIn this talk I will examine one recurring data-visualisation metaphor in contemporary popular videogames: Augmented Reality technology. By looking at a few case studies where this technology is used as a metaphorical window into the data systems behind games, I will attempt to surface some of the political and experiential biases this design culture entails for games, and also for the actual rising field of commercial personal AR devices. \nCover Photo (created by the UI designer of one of the games being analyzed)\n","bio":"","social_fb":"","social_web":"","videoLength":"11:17","videoYear":2018,"videoTags":"literacy, gaming","createdAt":{"$date":"2019-01-14T09:32:24.873Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2019-01-25T14:35:19.744Z"},"__v":0,"id":"5c3c57284660270017c01c63"}

From graphing an entire year’s news cycle, to mapping the way people share articles across the internet, to the 9/11 Memorial in Manhattan, Thorp’s cutting-edge visualizations use technology and data to help us learn about the way we use digital technologies, become more empathetic in the data age, and ultimately, tell the story of our lives. How can understanding the human side of data lead to innovation and effective change? What value is there in the novel and interactive approaches to data visualization? And, what are the business applications of creative data-focused research? Thorp teaches audiences how adding meaning and narrative to huge amounts of data can help people take control of the information that surrounds them, and revolutionize the way we utilize data.\n","bio":"Jer Thorp is an artist, writer and teacher living in New York City.
