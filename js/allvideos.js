        "Abstract": "Displaying data for exploration and analysis is a common use for data visualization. There are well-established rules that tell us how to show the data, what to show, what to leave out, etc. These rules are based on some sound research, so following them is generally a good idea.\n\nWhen it comes to communicating with data, however, things are different. The goals are no longer as clearly defined, and they differ considerably from the analytical and precise ones in the other tasks. Now we are after more high-level concepts like memory, engagement, and understanding. As a result, the approach needs to change. We can’t just assume that the same rules apply that served us when the goal is to precisely read the data.\n\nTelling stories with data is exciting because it opens up an entire new direction for research and creative work. The goal of this talk will be to tease apart the different goals, rules, and approaches, and to argue for a deeper understanding of what makes each of them different and unique.\n",

They use elements such as icons, symbols, and forms, in spatial arrays to convey rich meanings. They put ideas into the world, relieving cognitive load, structuring thought, and externalizing it for contemplation by individuals and groups in the service of inference, innovation, and collaboration. A broad range of examples, both historical and empirical, will show the many ways that external graphic representations reflect and affect thought.\n",

        "Abstract": "In recent years we have witnessed an explosion of the use of visualization as a means to communicate information to a broad audience. From journalists working in newspapers, to scientists in need to effectively communicate their scientific results, everyone seems to be interested in using this tool to boost their communication powers. Visualization however can both enlighten and obfuscate, empower and mislead, depending on how it is designed. For this reason it is crucial to (1) better understand under what circumstances it leads to positive rather than negative outcomes and (2) generate didactic material and processes for people to learn how to read visualization, to avoid being deceived, and how to design and develop visualizations to communicate effectively. In this talk I'll present some of the research developed in my lab at NYU aimed at solving some of the aforementioned problem. For instance, I will talk about our studies on whether visualization can lead to more persuasive messages and to major deceptions. I will also provide an historical perspective on visualization research and what I think needs to be done to further advance its state of the art.\n",

Recent developments in the field of indoor positioning systems make the acquisition and availability of visitor behavior data more attainable. However, the analysis of such data remains a challenge due to its noisiness, complexity and sheer size. The current talk describes the design and implementation of a visual system aimed at helping museum curators and personnel to better understand and analyze visitor behavior in their museum. We start by performing an analysis of the curators’ information needs, and accordingly we design visualizations that are based on the acquired data and address curators’ needs. Finally, we evaluated our design decisions by conducting an expert study with museum curators.",

In this talk I shall define visualisation comprehension basing on two relatively recent accounts of perception: Principles of Perceptual Organisation and the Reverse Hierarchy Theory. The resulting account enables evaluation that is not only objective, but also non-comparative, providing an absolute efficiency classification. As a sample application of this approach, a series of experiments studying the benefits of interactivity in 3D scatter plots will be presented.\n",

        "Abstract": "“Multi-million document collections have become common assets in many domains, such as medical, legal, scientific, commercial etc. While processing those collections is nowadays a routine task, not all problems have been solved. Some of the open issues are actually rather basic, for example, how to figure out what the collection is all about, that is, how to create a holistic view on the collection. Typical solutions are search (that provides a narrow visibility at the collection from the point of view of a query), and classification / clustering of the entire collection (which is either too coarse or not accurate enough).\nWe view a document collection as a graph where nodes are documents and edges are semantic similarities between the documents. While this representation is by no means novel, its construction is extremely challenging as it involves examining many trillions of document pairs. We employ existing Big Data technologies to overcome this challenge. The graph representation allows exploration of any topical region of the collection, as well as zooming in or out to evaluate density / analyze topology of various regions. Our approach does not solve the fundamental problem as the holistic view on the entire collection is still unachievable, however it provides visualization and exploration capabilities that cannot be obtained elsewhere. On an example of a collection of all patents issued in the US over the last 39 years, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach, and overview a variety of visualization schema.”\n",

        "Abstract": "Science fiction has broken the limit of the literary genres a long time ago. When it moved to other media, questions began to arise with how to describe the future: is the future a \"wibbly wobbly timey wimey thing\" or an unfolding of predetermined or \"fated\" events? Science fiction exists which takes either side, imagining the future both as something malleable and something set in stone, depending on the author and their politics.\nWhen it hit cinema and television, science fiction was suddenly faced with the question: \"how do these things look?\". From ships, through weapons and food, creators of science fiction suddenly had to become designers, industrial, informational, aesthetic or otherwise. As a data set, the future also requires visual representation, especially in visible media. When describing the future, how should our graphs look? Should we even use graphs? Can we not use images, probability clouds and other design tools to display the future?\nAs quickly as these questions were asked, they were answered by the timeline. Timelines as the ultimate representation of the future and, indeed, time itself, are everywhere in science fiction. From simple, linear timelines to intricate affairs with dozens of branches, the timeline has become THE method of describing the future, whether in the context of time travel, changing the future or simply dealing with the fact that the future exists, ever present and always ahead of us.\nWhat does that tell us? How does such representation change the way we think about the future within science fiction? Does it limit or broaden our ability to change what's coming? Finally, is it really the optimal way with which to display such a dynamic and varied body of data as the future? My talk will attempt to review the usages of timelines within science fiction and popular culture, all the while examining the presuppositions and politics of choosing such as a tool as the predominant way of representing the future.\n",

        "Abstract": "\"Lateral Movement\" is a techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move through a network as they search for the key data and assets that are ultimately the target of their attack campaigns. Targets can vary, one of which can be ‘stealing’ credentials and the identity of a high privilege account (= “sensitive” account).\n\nIn the cyber security world, thus, the end goal is to predict and protect from such threats and breaches within organizational networks. Verbally explaining how attackers move through networks clutters instant understanding and not always proves beneficial due to the volume of data and processes in the computer realm. Moreover, in the cyber security world “every second counts” especially when a real attack takes place. The end result in the UI must follow known UX/UI patterns and provide the end user sufficient and understandable output to act upon the displayed.\nThese and more make the medium of conveying the messaging in the product highly crucial. With all this in mind, we developed the ‘Lateral Movement Paths’ graph in the product, as part of the effort to layout the paths the attacker can potentially follow in order to reach a “sensitive” account. The flow graph breaks down the lateral movement paths to (1) individual paths that consist of (2) step by step components which lead to one of the sensitive accounts in the organization.\nThe development process had its challenges, since the graph component has to withstand both contextual and functional variations, such as changing amounts of paths and steps, different screen resolutions and sizes etc. And even before that, the decision-making phase of the feature definition had to take into consideration the highlighted components and steps from which each path would consist.\nCurrent result is a successful visual display of the potential lateral movement paths with the described challenges in mind and a novelty in terms of lay-outing the attackers’ movement in a coherent and visually straightforward way.\n",

        "Abstract": "As digital information continues to accumulate in our lives, information visualizations have become an increasingly relevant tool for discovering trends and shaping stories from this overabundance of data. Visualizations are typically designed based on the data to be displayed and the tasks to be supported, but they follow a one size-fits-all approach when it comes to user individual differences such as expertise, cognitive abilities, states and preferences. There is, however, mounting evidence that these user characteristics can significantly influence user experience during information visualization tasks. These findings have triggered research on user-adaptive visualizations, i.e.,,visualizations that can track and adapt to relevant user characteristics and specific needs.\nIn this talk, I will present results on which user individual differences can impact visualization processing and on how these differences can be captured using predictive models based on eye-tracking data. I will also discuss how to leverage these models to provide personalized support that can improve the user's experience with a visualization\n",

And would all these feelings lead to action?\nIn the past few years the use of dataviz have extended beyond the sciences and economics and into communication, politics and advocacy. While policy should be rooted in data, should advocacy do the same? And how can we account for the psychological phenomenons of statistical numbing and compassion fatigue that leads us to disengage from human suffering when it is presented to us in the masses? This talk would explore these contradictions and possible ways for addressing them.\n",

        "Abstract": "In digital games, all visuals are data visualizations. Not simply because data is the material of the digital medium, but because the nature of games themselves is that they are systems of data, and every action taken within them is essentially a manipulation of data.\nThroughout the history of pre-digital games, visual representations have been relatively close in fidelity to the amount of data and relations in the game system: maintaining a degree of abstraction relatively close to the degree by which the game simulation is an abstraction of reality itself (or the fictional reality the game depicts).\nWith the rise of computer graphics, the gap between game visuals and game systems began growing. In the last 4 decades, for a variety of cultural and technological reasons, game systems have not evolved as much as game graphics did. A mimetic desire, similar to that of the Realist movement in 19th art, have taken over games, and “Realistic” graphics are now pervasive in big-budget 3D videogames. But while this graphics culture seems more realistic in its relations to actual reality, it is excessive in relations to the systemic data it represents.\nSince “realistic” graphics are essentially a layer of fiction on top of the real data, bridging the gap between the player’s perception of the game reality and the systemic reality as it is calls for the use of metaphor.\nIn this talk I will examine one recurring data-visualisation metaphor in contemporary popular videogames: Augmented Reality technology. By looking at a few case studies where this technology is used as a metaphorical window into the data systems behind games, I will attempt to surface some of the political and experiential biases this design culture entails for games, and also for the actual rising field of commercial personal AR devices.\nCover Photo (created by the UI designer of one of the games being analyzed)\n",

In this paper, we contribute to this body of work with a study that investigates the impact of six user characteristics (four cognitive abilities and two personality traits) on visualizations that have yet to be investigated in research of visualization personalization, namely personalizing visualizations for analyzing time series. In particular, we focus on visualizations that have been extensively used for conveying emotional trends in social media. We measure users’ performance when performing tasks with four datasets extracted from Twitter and show that both the personality trait of locus of control and the cognitive ability of verbal working memory influences which visualization is more effective when dealing with demanding and complex tasks.",

        "Abstract": "Optimal design of the digital dashboard- the most widely used applications of BI, should consider different design aspects that directly impact its use. The research I preformed focuses on two critical design aspects, that have a substantial influence on the dashboard's usability and on the decision-making process it supports: Data presentation and Investigation capabilities.\n\nBusiness Intelligence applications support a wide range of both textual and graphical presentation methods. At present, there is no unanimity regarding the preference of certain presentation method over the other with regards to the manner of using the application or the users’ performance. Similarly, there is a lack of well-defined criteria for preferring specific investigation capability over the others – although those capabilities greatly affect the system's flexibility. Consequently, a set of heuristics and “rules of thumb” are used in designing those aspects. This contrasts with the fact that an optimal dashboard design is critical for maximizing the benefits from it for the users and for the BI system overall success.\n\nThe research was conducted as a response to the gap in the literature and to the ongoing demand for more empirical studies about the factors that affect the success of Business Intelligence systems. The core of the research is to examine the question: “How do the data presentation method and the investigation capabilities which exposed to the user affect the success of the Business Intelligence solution?”. The success' term is measured by both the quality of the decisions made using the BI application and the overall user satisfaction scores. This research question and the hypotheses derived from it, were tested in a controlled lab experiment conducted on a group of 91 students proficient in data analysis. The dataset used in the research consisted of educational data from high educational institute– data that aroused a lot of curiosity in recent years. The research's results are quite surprising and constitute a call for action for further research on the subject matter.\nThis research is part of my thesis which conducted with the supervised of Dr. Adir Even from Ben Gurion University.",

        "Abstract": "What happens when a mathematician (who is Israel’s leading statistician and pollster), a veteran journalist/author/editor, and an aspiring data scientist/developer team up to quantify and map the ways in which Jews in Israel practice Judaism? A new, interactive, model for understanding Jewish society in Israel is born. This lightening talk with Professor Camil Fuchs, Shmuel Rosner, and Noah Slepkov will discuss the #IsraeliJudaism project’s nonlinear journey from a goal of identifying the main characteristics of Jewish culture in Israel, to designing a 3000 person survey with close to 400 questions on how Israelis practice and observe Jewish and Israeli holidays and traditions, using statistical models to explore the data, mapping out a cultural revolution and identifying 4 types of Israeli Jews, building an algorithm to categorize respondents and place them within a model, visualizing the model through a simple graph, branding the project with an iconic Israeli character (Srulik), packaging the study into a book for the common Israeli (published by Kinneret-Zmora-Dvir), and building an interactive web platform for Israelis to answer a simple survey to see where they fit within the map of #IsraeliJudaism and enabling users to explore where various groups within Jewish Israeli society fit within the model. The net result of the process goes beyond delivering coherent research findings. The demand for dynamic synergy between user interaction and data visualization yielded new insights that would otherwise have not been found - in this context a new model for understanding Israeli Judaism. “#IsraeliJudaism, A Portrait of a Cultural Revolution” is a project of the Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) in Jerusalem. The project is headed by JPPI Senior Fellow Shmuel Rosner and Tel Aviv University Professor Emeritus Camil Fuchs, JPPI Fellow Noah Slepkov aided in data analysis and was responsible for data visualization and web site creation and development.",

Following the breakthrough in research on spatial inequality facilitated by VR technology, we propose “social topography” as a theory and a modelling method that stands to make a significant contribution to both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Social topography, we maintain, creates a new sociology: one of contour lines and spatially embedded hierarchies that exists under VR conditions and enables us to put on 3D glasses and go where the research community has not yet gone before.",

        "Abstract": "Cities are in great need for quantitative metrics to assess performance of urban neighborhoods and the level of service they provide to their residents. Such metrics are essential to support decision-making processes in the practice of city planning on one end; and for residents’ real-estate decisions about where to move or live on the other. Illuminating the spatial and social inequalities between neighborhoods through data-driven tools is valuable and essential to advance city planning and real estate development.\n\nThis short talk will showcases a data visualization tool for understanding the spatial inequalities in accessibility to services and amenities in cities around the world (see a pilot version of the tool here: https://taliakaufmann.github.io/accessmap/). The tool visualizes results from an ongoing research collaboration with the Urban Unit and the International Transport Forum (ITF) at the OECD (Organization for Economic Collaboration and Development). The visualization tool allows users to browse through different cities and compare the average travel time and the diversity of accessible amenities by walking, driving and public transportation in various neighborhoods. Future features will include filtering neighborhoods to meet users’ preferred standards of living, by choosing how long they will be willing to walk/drive/take public transport to various amenities. \n\nVisualizing access to resources on a global scale using fine-grain resolution data is of great value to both decision-makers and residents. The maps and metrics visualized will promote a discussion amongst decision-makers about where to invest further and which amenity types are lacking in which neighborhoods. Residents, on the other hand, can use the tool to compare their neighborhood to others in the city and push advocacy groups representing them to lobby for the lacking amenities in zoning committees. The tool can also help residents to choose the areas that meet their preferred standard of living for accessible amenities and the diversity of amenities within a neighborhood.",

        "Abstract": "People tend to think that coming up with the “brains” behind the tech product is the most difficult part of building a successful hi-tech company. They are right, of course. But what happens when you have managed to successfully build a super-smart machine learning decisioning system, that is rarely wrong, but now you need to explain HOW it is working to both your end users and your internal teams?\nThis is exactly the challenge that the design team over at Riskified was tasked with. Riskified is an established Israeli-based tech company that helps retailers around the world prevent online fraud and streamline the shopping experience for their customers. In simple words - our system delivers instant decisions about every online purchase - whether the individual who is trying to buy goods is a legitimate shopper or a fraudster using stolen credit card credentials. This is done using a sophisticated AI platform, built on advanced algorithms, which analyzes hundreds of data points relevant to each purchase including the customer’s online activity. While AI allows us to deliver incredibly accurate decisions, it’s not easy to “translate” the logic behind the system’s decisions to reasons that humans can comprehend. This challenge prompted Riskified’s Design team to create ‘The Featurator’ - an advanced data visualization tool that allows the end user to see what were the underlying reasons for the system’s decisions regarding each transaction. The creation process was complex and required some programming. Today, the Featurator delivers true business value and is widely used on a daily basis by people across teams.\nIn this short presentation, I will describe the work process and the thinking behind this data visualization tool. I will share examples of the various steps we went through until we managed to achieve the desired result. I think it is a good example of how Design teams can deliver significant value and help streamline business processes with data visualization tools. ",

We tell these stories, which we call “insights”, in a product that combines a visualistation map with other features, designed using Mapbox and Sketch.\n\nIt's exciting to have all these kinds of insights, but keeping the consistency and design coherence on the map, which lives in an interface that also has its own design system, is a pretty complicated task. Various types of insights require different types of visualizations; and since Mapbox’s interface is based on layers, a multiplicity of layers does not exactly speed up performance.\n\nIn the work progress, we realized that in order to succeed in this task, the map should have its own design system. Therefore, we charted the various types of visualizations we use, and the kinds of elements we need (line, polygon, etc.). \n\nBy doing that, we managed to reduce the number of layers significantly. Each layer, according to its metadata, was defined by data conditions and style expressions, thus creating various appearances, and a set of atoms and molecules which allow us to stay consistent. \n\nAt ISVIS, I'll demonstrate our map design workflow: from receiving the data, through its fabrication into design components. I will explain the logic of the system of design components we have created, through interesting true-to-life examples from Localize studio.\n\nSmart UX design understands data, uses it, and allows it to serve the concept while maximizing the experience. We are progressing towards a world where design and development are integrated, from the design phase onwards. ISVIS is great opportunity to discuss these fascinating innovations.",

A corpus based on the Upshot data section of the New York Times has been developed in order to examine the real world reactions to visualizations. Stories from 2014 to 2021 were gathered, in addition to audience responses in the comments section. The same number of stories were gathered from other sections as well. The final dataset contains more than seven thousand stories and over one million comments. A computational text analysis of audience comments shows that the Upshot facilitates the expression of analytical thinking and civility. However, there is no indication that it is related to the use of visualizations in the stories. A better understanding of how visualizations play a role in the story may allow them to be employed more effectively. ",

In short, how can, and have, we used data visualization to tell the future that we messed everything up? \n\n==========================================================\n\nThe impact of humanity on the world up until its current form of existence, and especially over the last three centuries of its existence, is, by now, an undebatable fact. “Climate change” doesn’t really begin to describe the scarification, pollution, and destruction that we have visited on the planet. What’s worse, these effects on our only home will last for generations; species take centuries to recover and greenhouse emissions even longer to disperse, not to mention the discarded (both literally and figuratively) nuclear waste that we have, and continue, to generate in our search for cleaner energy and bigger weapons.\n\nTherefore, the indelible impact of humanity raises questions beyond the practical, beyond the here and now; simply put, this impact raises the question: “how do we tell our children’s children’s children (and further) that we suck?” Many of our decisions will continue to haunt the planet, and our offspring, for potentially hundreds of thousands of years. If we cannot reverse these decisions, can we at least warn those who are to come after us? Sometimes, this warning will be nothing more than “well, sorry” but in other cases, such as the aforementioned nuclear one, this warning might save lives. Indeed, it might save all of humanity.\n\nOf course the question of whether we should issue these warnings is pretty simple; most people will answer in the positive, bar perhaps some especially pernicious types of nihilists. But the question of how to issue this warning is far more complex. Not only do physical objects erode with the passage of years but so does language. Meanings change, words are lost, entire lexicons fade into obscurity. What’s more, the concepts we are trying to communicate here are very subtle: fear, anxiety, concern, danger, death, illness, and more.\n\nThe best approach we might have open to us is the symbol. While even the more “primal” languages of symbol, pictograph or chart lose their communicative potency, they do so much more slowly than the written word and contain a potential to communicate with humans on a more fundamental level, perhaps “rolling back” some of the chronological gaps between us and our distant offspring.Thus, the question of how to talk to the future and warn them about the dangers we have left behind us strays from the realms of the written and into the realms of visualization.\n\nWhen attempting to visualize these dangers, fears, and warnings to the future, what types of symbols are used? How is data like material half-life, construction methods, environmental damages and risks, potential illness, and other such metrics communicated to people who might not have the underlying science to grasp them? What are the assumptions, politics, and limitations under which such work is undertaken and what do they expose about what we see as the future now and, of course, about the present which is attempting to communicate? In short, how can, and have, we used data visualization to tell the future that we messed everything up?",

        "Abstract": "Can interaction with mosses, interactive and intelligent plants that respond instantly to their environment and act as visual feedback, help prepare us for the cultural transformation needed to tackle the climate crisis? Destabilised Common Grounds is a participatory installation and workshop that utilise senses, information and technological elements to reveal the wisdom of moss and discuss the triangular relationship between human-nature-technology. \nIn this short talk I will present the project and discuss how we may use new forms of interaction and integrate living organisms into gamified feedback loops to facilitate the understanding of complex systems and the relationship between society and ecology.\nBy exploring moss colonies as uncompetitive, slow and resilient entities, This project is aiming to be a catalyst for discussion and activism while exposing the tensions between competition and ecological balance. The installation is designed as a game, where a moss rug acts as a playing board. Each player gets a territory of moss. Their goal is to keep it the greenest and most prosperous area. During the game, the players influence the climate of the moss using water spray, hot air and manipulating the rug’s topography. Two projections visualise the moss's reaction in real-time, one through a macro-lens view and another through a red filter emphasising the dry and vulnerable areas. As the game progresses, the participants would discover how their actions affect the moss’s condition. Would they change the course of the game and collaborate to balance the moss rug? \nThis project communicates scientific and ecological information through experience and visualisation to mediate the intangibility of environmental stewardship. Destabilised Common Grounds was developed during my MA at The Royal College of Art. It was exhibited at Menier Gallery, London, July 2021. The workshop was hosted at Contemporary Sculpture Fulmer, June 2021.\nMore about the project: [project website] (https://2021.rca.ac.uk/students/nirit-binyamini-ben-meir)",

Yet no matter what our timelines may imply, the future is not linear. It is not even a future, if anything they are plural, futures. Whether we visualize weather forecast, financial speculation, epidemiological modeling, environmental projections or strategic foresight, we need the right methodologies and visual metaphors to chart our paths forward. We invite you to join us in exploring how different visual representations of futures may expose different possibilities. In this workshop we will consider the variety of future visualization questions, chart types and metaphors for time. Do note, by the end of this workshop you may have more new questions than new answers, but we expect both would inform your reading and writing of the future, visually.",

        "Abstract": "The goal of visualization is to produce visual representations of complex relationships that would help users efficiently allocate their attention in order to better understand the data. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate and to measure the success of the visualization. This involves examining a number of factors, such as: techniques, methods, use efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction. \nEvaluation results are important for all stakeholders. Visual analytics integrators need to know use efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction; developers of a system that exploits visual analytics techniques need to know which ones to choose for the problem at hand; users selecting a system, method, or even a parameter setting need information to make the best decision. Furthermore, good evaluation results can help convince integrators and users to adopt novel techniques. Hence, evaluation of visualization is an important ingredient in innovation, from research to development to large-scale adoption. \nEven though the evaluation plays a crucial role in assessment of the quality of the visualization, it remains difficult and has many challengers. Current talk will address those challenges through examples from my research. \n",

One such convention is that, on a graph, numbers increase from the bottom up and from left to right. This left-to-right direction agrees with the left-to-right writing systems used by most of the world's population. However, around 8% of the world uses right-to-left (RTL) scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew. Previous research has shown that  RTL people perceive graphical information differently from their left-to-right (LTR) counterparts. Nevertheless, no empirical study tested how this perception differs when an RTL reader sees a graph.\nHere, we present a study performed with English, Hebrew, and Arabic speakers in which we managed to quantify the RTL effect on visual perception.

        "Abstract": "Last year, we participated in our first challenge with ‘Viz for Social Good’ - to visualize and raise awareness about the global water crisis and the work done by ‘Vera Aqua Vera Vita’ (VAVV). VAVV is a non-profit organization helping Peruvian communities get direct access to clean water. \nWe began this project with two questions: how can we create an empathic and positive story, and how can we truly engage our viewers?\nIn our talk, we would discuss our design process, challenges, outcomes, and upcoming plans, but mostly how we turned an impersonal and scarce dataset into a relatable data story for children. \n\nOne in five children worldwide lacks access to clean water (UNICEF). “No-water” communities face a high risk of children getting sick, missing school, or meeting life-threatening situations. Yet, how many of us know this or act upon it? \n\nWe created ‘Mayu’, a mobile-first project, and perhaps the first data-empathy coloring book designed for children. Mayu’s story illustrates the water crisis of seven communities in need in Piura, Peru, and how VAVV changes their lives. This data project aims at stimulating young viewers' empathy so they can reflect on and even comprehend the scale of the global water crisis. \n\nOur major challenge in this project was translating scarce data into a lively visual language and narrative. To achieve this, we generated a library of graphical objects for the data attributes we wanted to present. Then, we brought them together in story-based compositions to communicate specific information about each of the seven communities. Our data and data visualizations live in those explanatory compositions. Another significant challenge was how to create ‘Mayu’ with a mobile-first approach, which is often overlooked in digital visualizations. \n\n‘Mayu’ is a bilingual social campaign in English and Spanish. Children can participate by visiting the website, printing the stories, coloring them, and organizing fundraising activities for their classes, among other things. Mayu’s online visualizations will gradually come to life whenever a campaign is launched for one or more Piura communities, taking on color and movement as they reveal the fundraising progress. \n\n“From a distance, it’s easy to forget the dots are people” (Jake Harris). By zooming in, we experience impersonal data becoming personal. It’s time to act!  ",

        "Abstract": "Many community visualization challenges can be found online today: Events targeting specific tools – the #TidyTeusday project, #MakeOverMonday – and other tool agnostic challenges such as the 30daychartchallenge and 30daymapchallenge. They're open to anyone and everyone, beginners and advanced alike.\nIn some challenges you bring your own data – an old dataset you had laying around or something you've been wanting to explore for a while – while in other challenges the data is provided by the organizers. Both have their benefits, the former by engaging you with something you're sentimental about and the latter by challenging you with unknown data. \nWhile the challenges' themes are somewhat different, I found the events to be similar in how I learn and improve my visualizations. Coming with no proper background in data manipulation and visualizations, these challenges provided fruitful grounds to learn how to work with data and fit various charts to the takeaway at hand. As I became more confident I aspired for more: trying out new tools, experimenting with color and minimalism, breaking boundaries or further exploring my curiosity in personal projects.\nThe community participation had a propelling effect, providing both the opportunity and the positive feedback to continue. Besides meeting new friends and inspirational people it created a reason to participate as others did so too. Lastly, seeing others' visualizations of the same topics provided an additional perspective to challenges I just faced, learning about other practices and approaches. \nIn this talk I hope to share my personal experience participating in these challenges, share practices I learned and employ today as an analyst and hopefully motivate you to participate in an upcoming challenge.",

        "Abstract": "These days, more than ever, the world is converging, and quite a few nations are finding themselves for the first time, dealing with their existence, and their future survival. Several years ago, as part of a research I made in my MA in London college of Communication, I dealt with the identity of nations and how they perpetuate their existence through language and terminology.\n\nHow language is used as a tool in order to define and perpetuate nations. In my research I found four textual platforms: Declaration of independence, Anthems, Propaganda campaigns, and International code - each, with its use of specific phrases, words and terminology, manage to reflect the existence of the nation. Interestingly, in my research, I found out that each of the platforms also accurately expressed a different branding tool, such as: brand values, moto, logo and message. \n\nIn my lecture, I will give a brief overview of my research, and on the work of collecting and analysing the large data I have received in the first platform I have found: \"Declaration of independence\". Fascinating, after covering 30 different declarations, I found that this document holds exactly the same methodology like any commercial brand book, with three parts: the \"why,\" the \"what,\" and \"how.\" \n\nIn my research, using the official translated document that was provided by the nations, I put together all texts of the different 30 declarations of independence in a professional analytic tool to examine their words. I was curious to know how nations have chosen to define themselves: kingdom, state, country, republic, or land? How many times they used positive or negative words in the document, how did they formulate their goals and aims at the moment of declaration: democracy, freedom, rights, etc? Or what was the ratio between the words war and peace, life and death, or God and blood in the texts. \n\nI have summarized my research in one big and heavy book, that was edited like a magazine with 5 major chapters, and various short sections in between, embedded with statistics and infographics.",

However, this material is often dealt with digitally and rarely engaged with in a tangible, physical way. How would your ideas for a data project change if you started by drawing with crayon on paper instead of starting with code, dataviz software, and screens? For this workshop, data is our model on the plinth, and we'll be taking techniques from the world of art and design and applying them to data visualization.\n\nWe’ll explore how starting with sketching can offer various starting points for creating custom visualization methods, and learn how experimentation with mark-making and materials testing can be deployed to communicate information in new ways. By the end of this workshop, you'll both better understand the custom data visualizations design process and also have access to a variety of off-screen creative strategies for working with data and shaping its aesthetic (even if you move onto your computer / into code at a later point!)\n\nThe first half of the workshop will be a mix of lectures discussing dataviz basics through the lens of drawing combined with fast-paced creative exercises where participants work individually to sketch data offscreen using black crayon. Next, using a shared class dataset, attendees will work individually to create a custom visualization method and then draw their final visualization.",

We use the concept of Visual Information Flow (VIF), which is the underlying semantic structure that links graphical elements to convey the information and story to the user. To explore VIF, we collected a repository of over 13K infographics. We use a deep neural network to identify visual elements related to information, agnostic to their various artistic appearances. We construct the VIF by automatically chaining these visual elements together based on Gestalt principles. Using this analysis, we characterize the VIF design space by a taxonomy of 12 different design patterns. Exploring in a real-world infographic dataset, we discuss the design space and potentials of VIF in light of this taxonomy",

I wish to focus on the loss and ask whether we are losing anything essential by storytelling via data. This is a crucial question preceding the well-spoken issue of bias. In my talk, I will critique data visualisation as representing modern capitalist values of efficiency aiming to reduce the richness of life into a flat easy to handle performance. I would discuss and argue that by doing so, we lose the complexity and the messy hard-to-handle aspects of the experience.\nI will present the argument by highlighting two contradictory ideologies, starting with the one that helped to establish data visualisation as a representation of lively phenomena. Otho Neurath was among the leaders of “Logical Positivism”, the Vienna School at the beginning of the 20th century, and the author of its manifesto. He enthusiastically supported reduction, a philosophical, scientific methodology aiming to understand phenomena by reducing them into their smallest particle. Driven by scientific enlightenment-era beliefs, he developed the International Picture Language, ISOTYPE, using it as the visual performance of the school’s ideology. \nHorkheimer and Adorno later criticised this positivist approach and blamed reducing the life experience into “blind and mute data” as a limiting tool with cultural effects. \nMy talk will visually showcase this debate and its outcomes in our daily practice using data vis as the application of the reduction ideology. I will also show how it fits and serves neo-capitalist values at the expense of the live experience.\n",

Since designing interfaces for driving can be a significant challenge, the map and its layouts go through rigorous research and testing to ensure the utmost safety and quality.\n\nAfter working with B2C maps at Waze for almost a decade, I became the head of design for Sweep, a B2B startup. Sweep offers a powerful no-code editor that enables companies to manage their go-to-market (GTM) strategies on Salesforce. The editor automatically translates intricate business processes into flowchart-like structures on a canvas, allowing users to understand and modify the process.\n\nTransitioning from B2C to B2B products presented many challenges, but I quickly discovered similarities in the representation of complex systems, as both products rely heavily on visual elements, as maps and flowcharts do. I incorporated patterns I learned at Waze, such as color-coding, map layers, contextual zoom levels, and pins/comments, into Sweep.\n\nMy journey of creating better data visualization in Sweep's canvas is still evolving. However, I have demonstrated how fundamental UX patterns, hierarchy, and interface design principles can serve both B2C navigation apps and B2B no-code flowchart editors.\n",

We need to start thinking about the next step in data representation, which could give people a hands-on tool and inspire them to aim for more.",
