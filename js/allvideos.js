There are well-established rules that tell us how to show the data, what to show, what to leave out, etc. These rules are based on some sound research, so following them is generally a good idea.\n\nWhen it comes to communicating with data, however, things are different. The goals are no longer as clearly defined, and they differ considerably from the analytical and precise ones in the other tasks. Now we are after more high-level concepts like memory, engagement, and understanding. As a result, the approach needs to change. We can\u2019t just assume that the same rules apply that served us when the goal is to precisely read the data.\n\nTelling stories with data is exciting because it opens up an entire new direction for research and creative work. The goal of this talk will be to tease apart the different goals, rules, and approaches, and to argue for a deeper understanding of what makes each of them different and unique.\n", "bio": "Robert Kosara is a research scientist at Tableau Software.

From journalists working in newspapers, to scientists in need to effectively communicate their scientific results, everyone seems to be interested in using this tool to boost their communication powers.

For this reason it is crucial to (1) better understand under what circumstances it leads to positive rather than negative outcomes and (2) generate didactic material and processes for people to learn how to read visualization, to avoid being deceived, and how to design and develop visualizations to communicate effectively. In this talk I'll present some of the research developed in my lab at NYU aimed at solving some of the aforementioned problem.

Some of the open issues are actually rather basic, for example, how to figure out what the collection is all about, that is, how to create a holistic view on the collection. Typical solutions are search (that provides a narrow visibility at the collection from the point of view of a query), and classification / clustering of the entire collection (which is either too coarse or not accurate enough).\nWe view a document collection as a graph where nodes are documents and edges are semantic similarities between the documents. While this representation is by no means novel, its construction is extremely challenging as it involves examining many trillions of document pairs. We employ existing Big Data technologies to overcome this challenge. The graph representation allows exploration of any topical region of the collection, as well as zooming in or out to evaluate density / analyze topology of various regions. Our approach does not solve the fundamental problem as the holistic view on the entire collection is still unachievable, however it provides visualization and exploration capabilities that cannot be obtained elsewhere.

The visualization presents a compact representation that tells the story of the story in one glance. We show how our visualization can provide an imprint for different types of stories, enabling both comparison to other stories and means for analysis of the influence and evolution of a story. We demonstrate our technique on data coming from an online news aggregator platform. While specifically designed for news events, the method is also applicable for various types of time-series data that include intervening evolving events..\n", "bio": "My name is Julia Sheidin and I'm a PhD candidate in Information Systems Department at University of Haifa under the supervision of Prof. Tsvi Kuflik and Dr. Joel Lanir.

The aim of the project was developing a Multimedia Mobile guide based PDA (Pocket PC), which allows group guided tour at the museum as a substitute for a human instructor. My master thesis topic was to design, implement and evaluate an adaptive user interface for mobile museum visitor's guide.\nIn-betweens, I've worked for 7 years as Software Development Engineer at

Though it\u2019s commonly used in science, it vastly applies to the design of visuals as well (Edward Tufte\u2019s Data-Ink Ratio concept).

When it moved to other media, questions began to arise with how to describe the future: is the future a \"wibbly wobbly timey wimey thing\" or an unfolding of predetermined or \"fated\" events? Science fiction exists which takes either side, imagining the future both as something malleable and something set in stone, depending on the author and their politics.\nWhen it hit cinema and television, science fiction was suddenly faced with the question: \"how do these things look?\". From ships, through weapons and food, creators of science fiction suddenly had to become designers, industrial, informational, aesthetic or otherwise. As a data set, the future also requires visual representation, especially in visible media. When describing the future, how should our graphs look? Should we even use graphs? Can we not use images, probability clouds and other design tools to display the future?\nAs quickly as these questions were asked, they were answered by the timeline. Timelines as the ultimate representation of the future and, indeed, time itself, are everywhere in science fiction. From simple, linear timelines to intricate affairs with dozens of branches, the timeline has become THE method of describing the future, whether in the context of time travel, changing the future or simply dealing with the fact that the future exists, ever present and always ahead of us.\nWhat does that tell us? How does such representation change the way we think about the future within science fiction? Does it limit or broaden our ability to change what's coming? Finally, is it really the optimal way with which to display such a dynamic and varied body of data as the future? My talk will attempt to review the usages of timelines within science fiction and popular culture, all the while examining the presuppositions and politics of choosing such as a tool as the predominant way of representing the future.\n", "bio": "Eden Kupermintz is 30 and currently calls Tel Aviv, Israel home.

The flow graph breaks down the lateral movement paths to (1) individual paths that consist of (2) step by step components which lead to one of the sensitive accounts in the organization.\nThe development process had its challenges, since the graph component has to withstand both contextual and functional variations, such as changing amounts of paths and steps, different screen resolutions and sizes etc. And even before that, the decision-making phase of the feature definition had to take into consideration the highlighted components and steps from which each path would consist.\nCurrent result is a successful visual display of the potential lateral movement paths with the described challenges in mind and a novelty in terms of lay-outing the attackers\u2019 movement in a coherent and visually straightforward way.\n", "bio": "Anna Tsiganchuk, Product Designer and a User Experience thinker for complex systems for the last seven years.

There is, however, mounting evidence that these user characteristics can significantly influence user experience during information visualization tasks. These findings have triggered research on user-adaptive visualizations, i.e.,,visualizations that can track and adapt to relevant user characteristics and specific needs.\nIn this talk, I will present results on which user individual differences can impact visualization processing and on how these differences can be captured using predictive models based on eye-tracking data.

Not simply because data is the material of the digital medium, but because the nature of games themselves is that they are systems of data, and every action taken within them is essentially a manipulation of data.\nThroughout the history of pre-digital games, visual representations have been relatively close in fidelity to the amount of data and relations in the game system: maintaining a degree of abstraction relatively close to the degree by which the game simulation is an abstraction of reality itself (or the fictional reality the game depicts).\nWith the rise of computer graphics, the gap between game visuals and game systems began growing. In the last 4 decades, for a variety of cultural and technological reasons, game systems have not evolved as much as game graphics did. A mimetic desire, similar to that of the Realist movement in 19th art, have taken over games, and \u201cRealistic\u201d graphics are now pervasive in big-budget 3D videogames. But while this graphics culture seems more realistic in its relations to actual reality, it is excessive in relations to the systemic data it represents.\nSince \u201crealistic\u201d graphics are essentially a layer of fiction on top of the real data, bridging the gap between the player\u2019s perception of the game reality and the systemic reality as it is calls for the use of metaphor.\nIn this talk I will examine one recurring data-visualisation metaphor in contemporary popular videogames: Augmented Reality technology. By looking at a few case studies where this technology is used as a metaphorical window into the data systems behind games, I will attempt to surface some of the political and experiential biases this design culture entails for games, and also for the actual rising field of commercial personal AR devices.\nCover Photo (created by the UI designer of one of the games being analyzed)\n",

The research I preformed focuses on two critical design aspects, that have a substantial influence on the dashboard's usability and on the decision-making process it supports: Data presentation and Investigation capabilities.\n\nBusiness Intelligence applications support a wide range of both textual and graphical presentation methods. At present, there is no unanimity regarding the preference of certain presentation method over the other with regards to the manner of using the application or the users\u2019 performance. Similarly, there is a lack of well-defined criteria for preferring specific investigation capability over the others \u2013 although those capabilities greatly affect the system's flexibility. Consequently, a set of heuristics and \u201crules of thumb\u201d are used in designing those aspects. This contrasts with the fact that an optimal dashboard design is critical for maximizing the benefits from it for the users and for the BI system overall success.\n\nThe research was conducted as a response to the gap in the literature and to the ongoing demand for more empirical studies about the factors that affect the success of Business Intelligence systems. The core of the research is to examine the question: \u201cHow do the data presentation method and the investigation capabilities which exposed to the user affect the success of the Business Intelligence solution?\u201d. The success' term is measured by both the quality of the decisions made using the BI application and the overall user satisfaction scores. This research question and the hypotheses derived from it, were tested in a controlled lab experiment conducted on a group of 91 students proficient in data analysis. The dataset used in the research consisted of educational data from high educational institute\u2013 data that aroused a lot of curiosity in recent years. The research's results are quite surprising and constitute a call for action for further research on the subject matter.\nThis research is part of my thesis which conducted with the supervised of Dr. Adir Even from Ben Gurion University.", "bio": "fresh M.Sc graduate", "videoYear": 2019, "videoTags": "BI, industry, research", "__v": 0}, {"id": "recYctqM3RcNzcscl", "createdTime": "2022-04-24T14:34:30.000Z", "videoTitle": "Visualizing a Cultural Revolution", "youtubeID": "0WlZ4j9Pv9U", "videoAuthor": "Prof. Camil Fuchs, Shmuel Rosner & Noah Slepkov", "AuthorTagline": "The Jewish People Policy Insitute", "Abstract": "What happens when a mathematician (who is Israel\u2019s leading statistician and pollster), a veteran journalist/author/editor, and an aspiring data scientist/developer team up to quantify and map the ways in which Jews in Israel practice Judaism?

This lightening talk with Professor Camil Fuchs, Shmuel Rosner, and Noah Slepkov will discuss the #IsraeliJudaism project\u2019s nonlinear journey from a goal of identifying the main characteristics of Jewish culture in Israel, to designing a 3000 person survey with close to 400 questions on how Israelis practice and observe Jewish and Israeli holidays and traditions, using statistical models to explore the data, mapping out a cultural revolution and identifying 4 types of Israeli Jews, building an algorithm to categorize respondents and place them within a model, visualizing the model through a simple graph, branding the project with an iconic Israeli character (Srulik), packaging the study into a book for the common Israeli (published by Kinneret-Zmora-Dvir), and building an interactive web platform for Israelis to answer a simple survey to see where they fit within the map of #IsraeliJudaism and enabling users to explore where various groups within Jewish Israeli society fit within the model. The net result of the process goes beyond delivering coherent research findings.

Illuminating the spatial and social inequalities between neighborhoods through data-driven tools is valuable and essential to advance city planning and real estate development.\n\nThis short talk will showcases a data visualization tool for understanding the spatial inequalities in accessibility to services and amenities in cities around the world (see a pilot version of the tool here: https://taliakaufmann.github.io/accessmap/). The tool visualizes results from an ongoing research collaboration with the Urban Unit and the International Transport Forum (ITF) at the OECD (Organization for Economic Collaboration and Development). The visualization tool allows users to browse through different cities and compare the average travel time and the diversity of accessible amenities by walking, driving and public transportation in various neighborhoods. Future features will include filtering neighborhoods to meet users\u2019 preferred standards of living, by choosing how long they will be willing to walk/drive/take public transport to various amenities. \n\nVisualizing access to resources on a global scale using fine-grain resolution data is of great value to both decision-makers and residents. The maps and metrics visualized will promote a discussion amongst decision-makers about where to invest further and which amenity types are lacking in which neighborhoods. Residents, on the other hand, can use the tool to compare their neighborhood to others in the city and push advocacy groups representing them to lobby for the lacking amenities in zoning committees. The tool can also help residents to choose the areas that meet their preferred standard of living for accessible amenities and the diversity of amenities within a neighborhood.", "bio": "Architect, City Planner and data scientist developing data-driven tools for city planning", "social_web": "taliakaufmann.com; taliakaufmann.github.io/accessmap/", "videoYear": 2019, "videoTags": "politics, urban, tools, research, transportation", "__v": 0}, {"id": "recsFi0JJNwdcEXOa", "createdTime": "2022-04-24T14:34:30.000Z", "videoTitle": "Real world usage stories of AnSyn - an open source geospatial imagery visualization project", "youtubeID": "534kiqQ9jBs", "videoAuthor": "Idan Barak", "AuthorTagline": "VP product at Webiks", "Abstract": "More and more georeferenced images, taken from the ground, air and space, is collected on our planet on a daily basis.

But what happens when you have managed to successfully build a super-smart machine learning decisioning system, that is rarely wrong, but now you need to explain HOW it is working to both your end users and your internal teams?\nThis is exactly the challenge that the design team over at Riskified was tasked with. Riskified is an established Israeli-based tech company that helps retailers around the world prevent online fraud and streamline the shopping experience for their customers. In simple words - our system delivers instant decisions about every online purchase - whether the individual who is trying to buy goods is a legitimate shopper or a fraudster using stolen credit card credentials. This is done using a sophisticated AI platform, built on advanced algorithms, which analyzes hundreds of data points relevant to each purchase including the customer\u2019s online activity. While AI allows us to deliver incredibly accurate decisions, it\u2019s not easy to \u201ctranslate\u201d the logic behind the system\u2019s decisions to reasons that humans can comprehend. This challenge prompted Riskified\u2019s Design team to create \u2018The Featurator\u2019 - an advanced data visualization tool that allows the end user to see what were the underlying reasons for the system\u2019s decisions regarding each transaction. The creation process was complex and required some programming. Today, the Featurator delivers true business value and is widely used on a daily basis by people across teams.\nIn this short presentation, I will describe the work process and the thinking behind this data visualization tool.

What\u2019s worse, these effects on our only home will last for generations; species take centuries to recover and greenhouse emissions even longer to disperse, not to mention the discarded (both literally and figuratively) nuclear waste that we have, and continue, to generate in our search for cleaner energy and bigger weapons.\n\nTherefore, the indelible impact of humanity raises questions beyond the practical, beyond the here and now; simply put, this impact raises the question: \u201chow do we tell our children\u2019s children\u2019s children (and further) that we suck?\u201d Many of our decisions will continue to haunt the planet, and our offspring, for potentially hundreds of thousands of years. If we cannot reverse these decisions, can we at least warn those who are to come after us? Sometimes, this warning will be nothing more than \u201cwell, sorry\u201d but in other cases, such as the aforementioned nuclear one, this warning might save lives. Indeed, it might save all of humanity.\n\nOf course the question of whether we should issue these warnings is pretty simple; most people will answer in the positive, bar perhaps some especially pernicious types of nihilists. But the question of how to issue this warning is far more complex. Not only do physical objects erode with the passage of years but so does language. Meanings change, words are lost, entire lexicons fade into obscurity. What\u2019s more, the concepts we are trying to communicate here are very subtle: fear, anxiety, concern, danger, death, illness, and more.\n\nThe best approach we might have open to us is the symbol. While even the more \u201cprimal\u201d languages of symbol, pictograph or chart lose their communicative potency, they do so much more slowly than the written word and contain a potential to communicate with humans on a more fundamental level, perhaps \u201crolling back\u201d some of the chronological gaps between us and our distant offspring.Thus, the question of how to talk to the future and warn them about the dangers we have left behind us strays from the realms of the written and into the realms of visualization.\n\nWhen attempting to visualize these dangers, fears, and warnings to the future, what types of symbols are used? How is data like material half-life, construction methods, environmental damages and risks, potential illness, and other such metrics communicated to people who might not have the underlying science to grasp them? What are the assumptions, politics, and limitations under which such work is undertaken and what do they expose about what we see as the future now and, of course, about the present which is attempting to communicate?

The installation is designed as a game, where a moss rug acts as a playing board. Each player gets a territory of moss. Their goal is to keep it the greenest and most prosperous area. During the game, the players influence the climate of the moss using water spray, hot air and manipulating the rug\u2019s topography. Two projections visualise the moss's reaction in real-time, one through a macro-lens view and another through a red filter emphasising the dry and vulnerable areas.

Therefore, there is a need to evaluate and to measure the success of the visualization. This involves examining a number of factors, such as: techniques, methods, use efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction. \nEvaluation results are important for all stakeholders. Visual analytics integrators need to know use efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction; developers of a system that exploits visual analytics techniques need to know which ones to choose for the problem at hand; users selecting a system, method, or even a parameter setting need information to make the best decision. Furthermore, good evaluation results can help convince integrators and users to adopt novel techniques. Hence, evaluation of visualization is an important ingredient in innovation, from research to development to large-scale adoption. \nEven though the evaluation plays a crucial role in assessment of the quality of the visualization, it remains difficult and has many challengers. Current talk will address those challenges through examples from my research. \n", "bio": "Mom, Lecturer and a PhD student", "videoYear": 2022, "videoTags": "research"}, {"id": "rec6whdC7WWv0yTOT", "createdTime": "2022-06-27T07:26:15.000Z", "videoTitle": "Direction matters.

Much of the perception relies on conventions that seem standard and obvious. One such convention is that, on a graph, numbers increase from the bottom up and from left to right. This left-to-right direction agrees with the left-to-right writing systems used by most of the world's population. However, around 8% of the world uses right-to-left (RTL) scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew. Previous research has shown that  RTL people perceive graphical information differently from their left-to-right (LTR) counterparts. Nevertheless, no empirical study tested how this perception differs when an RTL reader sees a graph.\nHere, we present a study performed with English, Hebrew, and Arabic speakers in which we managed to quantify the RTL effect on visual perception.

Data visualization is a go-to approach because it leverages our natural abilities as humans to see trends, spot patterns, and identify outliers. A good visualization amplifies cognition and improves decision making.  This works very well for those who can see. \n\nSo the question is this: How do we represent data in a way that provides the same value to everyone, regardless of ability? As a co-author of Material Design\u2019s Data Visualization Guidelines, I\u2019ll reframe Google\u2019s six principles for data visualization and outline how we\u2019re applying them at scale to create more inclusive and accessible representations of data that provide insights for everyone. \n\nKey Takeaways: \nHow might accessibility standards empower design rather than constraining it. \nHow might we create multi sensory data experiences that provide value and insights the same way a chart provides insights to a sighted person. \nHow do we scale our work in data accessibility in

In response, the visualization community is producing charts, maps, graphics, and illustrations every day addressing biomedical, social, economic, and public health issues. COVIC, a collection of over 12,000 visualizations from over 30 countries, organized by a rich set of metadata including visualization type, subject, and publisher, is a new design research tool born from this collective effort.", "bio": "Paul Kahn is responsible for the conception and direction of the Covid-19 Online Visualization Collection (COVIC). He has been teaching Information Design History at Northeastern University\u2019s Information Design & Data Visualization program since 2015. He specializes in solving large information problems, shaping and designing collections of digital information to improve user experience. Paul created the first agency in France focused on information architecture, preceded by a decade leading Dynamic Diagrams in Providence RI. He served as Experience Design Director at Mad*Pow and now devotes himself entirely to teaching and writing in the US and France.\n\n\nPaolo Ciuccarelli is Professor of Design at Northeastern after twenty years at Politecnico di Milano in Italy. At Politecnico he coordinated the Communication Design program (BSc and MSc), has been member of the board at the PhD in Design and he founded the DensityDesign Research Lab, an award winning laboratory for data visualization and information design. Paolo\u2019s research focuses on the design transformations that help making sense of data and information to improve decision making processes, especially with non experts stakeholders and for controversial complex social issues where he\u2019s also experimenting on the role of rhetorics and visual poetry for a deeper engagement. He also works in developing tools and methods to understanding the evolution of the design discipline in the frame of a meta-design approach. \n\u2028Paolo Ciuccarelli is author of best-paper awarded publications, lectured at Royal College of Arts, ENSCI Les Ateliers, Glasgow School of Arts, King\u2019s College and Stanford Humanities Centre and has been invited to talk at conferences such as Eyeo, TEDx, Visualized, NetSci, Congreso Futuro.
