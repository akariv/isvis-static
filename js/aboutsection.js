The Book of Trees\n\n<br/>\n\n<!--\nAs more and more data is being gathered and as data-driven algorithmic analysis moves more and more decision making power behind the scenes, data visualization emerges as a crucial interface between humans and machines. Dataviz manifests again through two conflicting trends, on one hand the popularization of science and click-bait infographics, and on the other hand the age of post-truth, science-denialism, fake news and deep-fakes. In light of these pressing issues we want to examine once more the practical, critical and creative aspects of visualization in industry, academia, journalism, politics and civic discourse.\n-->\n\nFollowing the successful ISVIS 2022 at Shenkar, we are very happy to announce that ISVIS, the Israeli information visualization conference, will be gathering again, this year at the University of Haifa!\n\nISVIS will be held as a full day conference, open to all, on May 17th, 2023. \n\nDuring this day, we will continue the ISVIS interdisciplinary tradition and host a wide variety of researchers and practitioners from Israel and abroad for a discussion on the crossroads between design, engineering, communication, cognitive psychology, academia and industry. \n\n<!--\n### Open call\n\nIn addition to an invited international speaker, we will be glad to widen our scope and invite the local community and encourage you to present your work and research in the conference.\n\nPlease notice! All talks this year will be allocated the same time: 13 minutes per presentation. If you wish to suggest a different type of presentation, please indicate this in the comments.\n\nTopics can be from, but are not limited to:\n\n• Cognitive research in visualization\n• Engineering aspects of visualization\n• Visualization and digital humanities\n• Data Journalism\n• Contemporary Mapping\n• New trends in information design\n• Questions of ethics and responsibility in visualization\n• Visualization and User Experience\n• Visualization literacy\n• Visualizing Uncertainty\n• Visualizing Algorithms\n• Visualization and Big Data\n• Visualization and BioInformatics\n• Info-activism and visualization\n• Case studies from industry and academia\n• Teaching visualization\n• Between visualization and simulation\n• Visualization and Deep Learning\n• Data art\n• Dashboard design\n• Micro-visualization\n• Evaluation of visualization\n\nTalks can be in English or Hebrew\n-->\n\n## Important dates:\n\n**Jan 25th** - Open call starts\n\n**March 7th** - Open call ==DEADLINE==\n\n**March 16th** - Answers sent\n\n**May 10th** - Early Bird tickets deadline\n\n**May 16th** - Designing Better Data Products for AI / Workshop with Leticia Pozza\n\n**May 17th** - ISVIS Conference Day\n\n## Designing Better Data Products for AI / Workshop with Leticia Pozza\n\nData products are a holistic view of our data solution. They encompass every decision from the analytical solutions, to the format, to the media that will host it. As professionals, we tend to focus on how to visualize information, forgetting these other steps to properly reach our audience. And in cases where the data solution is as complex as a machine learning model, keeping a product mindset can bridge the gap between your solution and your final user.\nIn this 2.5-hour workshop, we will go through different scenarios, users, and situations, to break the mold of the traditional digital dashboard, focusing on data products to interact with Artificial Intelligence.\n\n16.5.2023 Tuesday 10:30 -13:00\nCity campus, Amir building (65 Hanamal st.), Room 508\n\n## Location:\n\nThe conference will be held at the University of Haifa campus at the Hecht auditorium. \n\nThe best way to reach university of haifa is by train and cable car. Take the train and get off at \"HaMifrats station\" and from there take the cable car (רכבלית) directly to the University. For the Hecht auditorium, follow the signs to the Hecht museum. \n<!--\nWe hope to <a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrEkAa7qiZE2nyXU\" target=\"_blank\">hear from you soon</a>,\n-->\n\n<br/>\nFor any question gmail us at: isvisconf\n<br/>\n\n<br/>\nJoel Lanir (University of Haifa)\n\nMushon Zer-Aviv (Shenkar).\n\nMeira Levy (Shenkar),\n\nYael Albo (Samuel Neaman Institute)\n\n<!--\n<style>\nbody.style-intro {\nbackground: #52e78c;\n}\n</style>\n-->"
