The Book of Trees\n\n<br/>\n\n<!--\nAs more and more data is being gathered and as data-driven algorithmic analysis moves more and more decision making power behind the scenes, data visualization emerges as a crucial interface between humans and machines. Dataviz manifests again through two conflicting trends, on one hand the popularization of science and click-bait infographics, and on the other hand the age of post-truth, science-denialism, fake news and deep-fakes. In light of these pressing issues we want to examine once more the practical, critical and creative aspects of visualization in industry, academia, journalism, politics and civic discourse.\n-->\n\nFollowing the successful ISVIS 2022 at Shenkar, we are very happy to announce that ISVIS, the Israeli information visualization conference, will be gathering again, this year at the University of Haifa!\n\nISVIS will be held as a full day conference, open to all, on May 17th, 2023.\u00a0\n\nDuring this day, we will continue the ISVIS interdisciplinary tradition and host a wide variety of researchers and practitioners from Israel and abroad for a discussion on the crossroads between design, engineering, communication, cognitive psychology, academia and industry.\u00a0\n\n<!--\n### Open call\n\nIn addition to an invited international speaker, we will be glad to widen our scope and invite the local community and encourage you to present your work and research in the conference.\n\nPlease notice!
