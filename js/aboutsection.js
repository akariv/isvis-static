They look complete, true, whole, certain, scientific, neutral\u2026 in particular for people who don't make them.\u201d**\n\n> \u2014<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdRilsNmXX0\" target=\"_blank\">Catherine D\u2019Ignazio at ISVIS 2017</a>\n\nAs more and more data is being gathered and as data-driven algorithmic analysis moves more and more decision making power behind the scenes, data visualization emerges as a crucial interface between humans and machines. Dataviz manifests again through two conflicting trends, on one hand the popularization of science and click-bait infographics, and on the other hand the age of post-truth, science-denialism, fake news and deep-fakes. In light of these pressing issues we want to examine once more the practical, critical and creative aspects of visualization in industry, academia, journalism, politics and civic discourse.\n\nOn the week of the 8-12  of May, 2022, we will meet for the sixth time at ISVIS, the Israeli Visualization conference, to explore the local and international developments in dataviz. \n\nYes! This year ISVIS is extending for an entire week. From May 8th-May 11th, we will hold online workshops with leading world known visualization persons: Lisa Charlotte Muth, Paul Kahn, Paolo Ciuccarelli, Stephanie Posavec, and Amanda Cox. \n\nWe will continue ISVIS\u2019s tradition and have a full day physical conference where we will host a wide variety of researchers and practitioners from Israel and abroad for a discussion on the crossroads between design, engineering, communication, cognitive psychology, academy and industry. The conference will take place this year again at Shenkar college at Ramat-Gan.\n\n<!--\n### Open call\n\nIn past years ISVIS hosted the leading visualization researchers and practiotioners including Moritz Stefaner, Catherine D'Ignazio, Barbara Tversky, Robert Kosara, Enrico Bertini and others...
