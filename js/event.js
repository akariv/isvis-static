From graphing an entire year’s news cycle, to mapping the way people share articles across the internet, to the 9/11 Memorial in Manhattan, Thorp’s cutting-edge visualizations use technology and data to help us learn about the way we use digital technologies, become more empathetic in the data age, and ultimately, tell the story of our lives. How can understanding the human side of data lead to innovation and effective change? What value is there in the novel and interactive approaches to data visualization? And, what are the business applications of creative data-focused research? Thorp teaches audiences how adding meaning and narrative to huge amounts of data can help people take control of the information that surrounds them, and revolutionize the way we utilize data.

Its response to this challenge is a 3D regional model based on the immersive visualization theater (VizLab) maintained by the Technion's Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning. Following the breakthrough in research on spatial inequality facilitated by VR technology, we propose “social topography” as a theory and a modelling method that stands to make a significant contribution to both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Social topography, we maintain, creates a new sociology: one of contour lines and spatially embedded hierarchies that exists under VR conditions and enables us to put on 3D glasses and go where the research community has not yet gone before.","meta":"","authorDesc":"Urban sociologist faculty of Architecture an Town Planing, Technion","authorBio":"","authorSocial":"[maharon.net.technion.ac.il/](https://maharon.net.technion.ac.il/)\n\n[facebook.com/meirav.a.gutman](https://www.facebook.com/meirav.a.gutman)","eventParent":"(5)Placemaking","createdAt":{"$date":"2019-04-07T15:31:45.218Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2019-04-07T15:31:45.483Z"},"__v":0,"id":"5caa17e1222bc1001775182d"},

In this paper, we contribute to this body of work with a study that investigates the impact of six user characteristics (four cognitive abilities and two personality traits) on visualizations that have yet to be investigated in research of visualization personalization, namely personalizing visualizations for analyzing time series. In particular, we focus on visualizations that have been extensively used for conveying emotional trends in social media. We measure users’ performance when performing tasks with four datasets extracted from Twitter and show that both the personality trait of locus of control and the cognitive ability of verbal working memory influences which visualization is more effective when dealing with demanding and complex tasks.","meta":"","authorDesc":"Doctoral Candidate at the Information Systems department at Haifa University and a faculty member at the Software Engineering department at ORT Braude College.","authorBio":"Doctoral Candidate at the Information Systems department at Haifa University and a faculty member at the Software Engineering department at ORT Braude College.","authorSocial":"[haifahci.net/people/julia-sheidin/](http://haifahci.net/people/julia-sheidin/)","eventParent":"(6)Research Findings","createdAt":{"$date":"2019-04-07T15:37:56.411Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2019-04-07T15:37:56.626Z"},"__v":0,"id":"5caa1954222bc10017751832"},

A new, interactive, model for understanding Jewish society in Israel is born. This lightening talk with Professor Camil Fuchs, Shmuel Rosner, and Noah Slepkov will discuss the #IsraeliJudaism project’s nonlinear journey from a goal of identifying the main characteristics of Jewish culture in Israel, to designing a 3000 person survey with close to 400 questions on how Israelis practice and observe Jewish and Israeli holidays and traditions, using statistical models to explore the data, mapping out a cultural revolution and identifying 4 types of Israeli Jews, building an algorithm to categorize respondents and place them within a model, visualizing the model through a simple graph, branding the project with an iconic Israeli character (Srulik), packaging the study into a book for the common Israeli (published by Kinneret-Zmora-Dvir), and building an interactive web platform for Israelis to answer a simple survey to see where they fit within the map of #IsraeliJudaism and enabling users to explore where various groups within Jewish Israeli society fit within the model. The net result of the process goes beyond delivering coherent research findings. The demand for dynamic synergy between user interaction and data visualization yielded new insights that would otherwise have not been found - in this context a new model for understanding Israeli Judaism. “#IsraeliJudaism, A Portrait of a Cultural Revolution” is a project of the Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) in Jerusalem.

They are right, of course. But what happens when you have managed to successfully build a super-smart machine learning decisioning system, that is rarely wrong, but now you need to explain HOW it is working to both your end users and your internal teams?\nThis is exactly the challenge that the design team over at Riskified was tasked with. Riskified is an established Israeli-based tech company that helps retailers around the world prevent online fraud and streamline the shopping experience for their customers. In simple words - our system delivers instant decisions about every online purchase - whether the individual who is trying to buy goods is a legitimate shopper or a fraudster using stolen credit card credentials. This is done using a sophisticated AI platform, built on advanced algorithms, which analyzes hundreds of data points relevant to each purchase including the customer’s online activity. While AI allows us to deliver incredibly accurate decisions, it’s not easy to “translate” the logic behind the system’s decisions to reasons that humans can comprehend. This challenge prompted Riskified’s Design team to create ‘The Featurator’ - an advanced data visualization tool that allows the end user to see what were the underlying reasons for the system’s decisions regarding each transaction. The creation process was complex and required some programming. Today, the Featurator delivers true business value and is widely used on a daily basis by people across teams.\nIn this short presentation, I will describe the work process and the thinking behind this data visualization tool.

In this talk i will briefly describe AnSyn project characteristics, and spend most of the time going through real world usage stories and use cases of AnSyn project relevant to ISVIS participants fields of interest:\n1) Data journalism - The monitoring and damage assessment of the 2018 California wildfires.\n2) Contemporary mapping - the crowdsourcing of the cartography field using OpenStreetMap web mapping services (https://www.openstreetmap.org).\n\nyou can check out AnSyn at: http://ansyn.io/#/\"","meta":"","authorDesc":"Die hard Liverpool football club fan,  ‘Less Than Amateur’ drone operator, UX designer and product manager of web mapping and geospatial visualization tools for about 9 years.","authorBio":"","authorSocial":"[website](https://webiks.com/)\n[twitter](https://twitter.com/therealwebiks)","eventParent":"(5)Placemaking","createdAt":{"$date":"2019-04-08T22:41:36.604Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2019-04-08T22:46:23.34Z"},"__v":0,"id":"5cabce200855120017b4746c"},

We tell these stories, which we call “insights”, in a product that combines a visualistation map with other features, designed using Mapbox and Sketch.\n\nIt's exciting to have all these kinds of insights, but keeping the consistency and design coherence on the map, which lives in an interface that also has its own design system, is a pretty complicated task. Various types of insights require different types of visualizations; and since Mapbox’s interface is based on layers, a multiplicity of layers does not exactly speed up performance.\n\nIn the work progress, we realized that in order to succeed in this task, the map should have its own design system. Therefore, we charted the various types of visualizations we use, and the kinds of elements we need (line, polygon, etc.). \n\nBy doing that, we managed to reduce the number of layers significantly. Each layer, according to its metadata, was defined by data conditions and style expressions, thus creating various appearances, and a set of atoms and molecules which allow us to stay consistent. \n\nAt ISVIS, I'll demonstrate our map design workflow: from receiving the data, through its fabrication into design components. I will explain the logic of the system of design components we have created, through interesting true-to-life examples from Localize studio.\n\nSmart UX design understands data, uses it, and allows it to serve the concept while maximizing the experience. We are progressing towards a world where design and development are integrated, from the design phase onwards. ISVIS is great opportunity to discuss these fascinating innovations.\"","meta":"","authorDesc":"UX and Maps designer ","authorBio":"","authorSocial":"[website](https://aicf.org/artist/rotem-adrian/)\n","eventParent":"(5)Placemaking","createdAt":{"$date":"2019-04-08T22:45:31.527Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2019-04-09T10:47:17.191Z"},"__v":0,"id":"5cabcf0b0855120017b4746f"},

The research I preformed focuses on two critical design aspects, that have a substantial influence on the dashboard's usability and on the decision-making process it supports: Data presentation and Investigation capabilities.\n\nBusiness Intelligence applications support a wide range of both textual and graphical presentation methods. At present, there is no unanimity regarding the preference of certain presentation method over the other with regards to the manner of using the application or the users’ performance. Similarly, there is a lack of well-defined criteria for preferring specific investigation capability over the others – although those capabilities greatly affect the system's flexibility. Consequently, a set of heuristics and “rules of thumb” are used in designing those aspects. This contrasts with the fact that an optimal dashboard design is critical for maximizing the benefits from it for the users and for the BI system overall success.\n\nThe research was conducted as a response to the gap in the literature and to the ongoing demand for more empirical studies about the factors that affect the success of Business Intelligence systems. The core of the research is to examine the question: “How do the data presentation method and the investigation capabilities which exposed to the user affect the success of the Business Intelligence solution?”. The success' term is measured by both the quality of the decisions made using the BI application and the overall user satisfaction scores. This research question and the hypotheses derived from it, were tested in a controlled lab experiment conducted on a group of 91 students proficient in data analysis. The dataset used in the research consisted of educational data from high educational institute– data that aroused a lot of curiosity in recent years. The research's results are quite surprising and constitute a call for action for further research on the subject matter.\nThis research is part of my thesis which conducted with the supervised of Dr. Adir Even from Ben Gurion University.\"","meta":"","authorDesc":"fresh M.Sc graduate","authorBio":"","authorSocial":"","eventParent":"(6)Research Findings","createdAt":{"$date":"2019-04-08T22:51:16.058Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2019-04-08T22:54:17.105Z"},"__v":0,"id":"5cabd0640855120017b47474"},
