Species recovery, greenhouse emission dissipation and nuclear waste decay will all take generations. When visualizing these dangers, fears, and warnings to the future, what types of symbols are used? How is data communicated to people who might not have the underlying science to grasp them? What are the assumptions, politics, and limitations under which such work is undertaken and what do they expose about the present which is attempting to communicate? In short, how can, and have, we used data visualization to tell the future that we messed everything up? \n\n==========================================================\n\nThe impact of humanity on the world up until its current form of existence, and especially over the last three centuries of its existence, is, by now, an undebatable fact. \u201cClimate change\u201d doesn\u2019t really begin to describe the scarification, pollution, and destruction that we have visited on the planet. What\u2019s worse, these effects on our only home will last for generations; species take centuries to recover and greenhouse emissions even longer to disperse, not to mention the discarded (both literally and figuratively) nuclear waste that we have, and continue, to generate in our search for cleaner energy and bigger weapons.\n\nTherefore, the indelible impact of humanity raises questions beyond the practical, beyond the here and now; simply put, this impact raises the question: \u201chow do we tell our children\u2019s children\u2019s children (and further) that we suck?\u201d Many of our decisions will continue to haunt the planet, and our offspring, for potentially hundreds of thousands of years. If we cannot reverse these decisions, can we at least warn those who are to come after us? Sometimes, this warning will be nothing more than \u201cwell, sorry\u201d but in other cases, such as the aforementioned nuclear one, this warning might save lives. Indeed, it might save all of humanity.\n\nOf course the question of whether we should issue these warnings is pretty simple; most people will answer in the positive, bar perhaps some especially pernicious types of nihilists. But the question of how to issue this warning is far more complex. Not only do physical objects erode with the passage of years but so does language.

What\u2019s worse, these effects on our only home will last for generations; species take centuries to recover and greenhouse emissions even longer to disperse, not to mention the discarded (both literally and figuratively) nuclear waste that we have, and continue, to generate in our search for cleaner energy and bigger weapons.\n\nTherefore, the indelible impact of humanity raises questions beyond the practical, beyond the here and now; simply put, this impact raises the question: \u201chow do we tell our children\u2019s children\u2019s children (and further) that we suck?\u201d Many of our decisions will continue to haunt the planet, and our offspring, for potentially hundreds of thousands of years. If we cannot reverse these decisions, can we at least warn those who are to come after us? Sometimes, this warning will be nothing more than \u201cwell, sorry\u201d but in other cases, such as the aforementioned nuclear one, this warning might save lives. Indeed, it might save all of humanity.\n\nOf course the question of whether we should issue these warnings is pretty simple; most people will answer in the positive, bar perhaps some especially pernicious types of nihilists. But the question of how to issue this warning is far more complex. Not only do physical objects erode with the passage of years but so does language. Meanings change, words are lost, entire lexicons fade into obscurity. What\u2019s more, the concepts we are trying to communicate here are very subtle: fear, anxiety, concern, danger, death, illness, and more.\n\nThe best approach we might have open to us is the symbol. While even the more \u201cprimal\u201d languages of symbol, pictograph or chart lose their communicative potency, they do so much more slowly than the written word and contain a potential to communicate with humans on a more fundamental level, perhaps \u201crolling back\u201d some of the chronological gaps between us and our distant offspring.Thus, the question of how to talk to the future and warn them about the dangers we have left behind us strays from the realms of the written and into the realms of visualization.\n\nWhen attempting to visualize these dangers, fears, and warnings to the future, what types of symbols are used?

He has been teaching Information Design History at Northeastern University\u2019s Information Design & Data Visualization program since 2015. He specializes in solving large information problems, shaping and designing collections of digital information to improve user experience. Paul created the first agency in France focused on information architecture, preceded by a decade leading Dynamic Diagrams in Providence RI. He served as Experience Design Director at Mad*Pow and now devotes himself entirely to teaching and writing in the US and France.\n\n\nPaolo Ciuccarelli is Professor of Design at Northeastern after twenty years at Politecnico di Milano in Italy. At Politecnico he coordinated the Communication Design program (BSc and MSc), has been member of the board at the PhD in Design and he founded the DensityDesign Research Lab, an award winning laboratory for data visualization and information design. Paolo\u2019s research focuses on the design transformations that help making sense of data and information to improve decision making processes, especially with non experts stakeholders and for controversial complex social issues where he\u2019s also experimenting on the role of rhetorics and visual poetry for a deeper engagement. He also works in developing tools and methods to understanding the evolution of the design discipline in the frame of a meta-design approach. \n\u2028Paolo Ciuccarelli is author of best-paper awarded publications, lectured at Royal College of Arts, ENSCI Les Ateliers, Glasgow School of Arts, King\u2019s College and Stanford Humanities Centre and has been invited to talk at conferences such as Eyeo, TEDx, Visualized, NetSci, Congreso Futuro.

I was excited, overwhelmed, and insecure. \nI was in Portsmouth, UK, 3,000 miles away from my home in Israel, and I did not know the first thing about doctor\u2019s appointments or pregnancy. Plus, all my focus was on my studies; I was at the data collecting stage of my Master\u2019s degree at the University. My husband wiped off my tears and cheered me up immediately. \u201cChange your perspective,\u201d he urged me. \u201cYou are a data-driven person. Look at your bookshelf, Observe, Collect, Draw! Could you do it? Read, collect data on the pregnancy, and make the most of the situation.\u201d \n\nTime throughout my pregnancy passed by very quickly. I had my newborn son in my hands in a blink. I was trying to find my pathway in this \u201cunknown territory\u201d called motherhood. I decided to look at my struggles, problems, and difficulties as an opportunity and seek the story within the data.

For this workshop, data is our model on the plinth, and we'll be taking techniques from the world of art and design and applying them to data visualization.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore how starting with sketching can offer various starting points for creating custom visualization methods, and learn how experimentation with mark-making and materials testing can be deployed to communicate information in new ways. By the end of this workshop, you'll both better understand the custom data visualizations design process and also have access to a variety of off-screen creative strategies for working with data and shaping its aesthetic (even if you move onto your computer / into code at a later point!)\n\nThe first half of the workshop will be a mix of lectures discussing dataviz basics through the lens of drawing combined with fast-paced creative exercises where participants work individually to sketch data offscreen using black crayon.

However, this material is often dealt with digitally and rarely engaged with in a tangible, physical way. How would your ideas for a data project change if you started by drawing with crayon on paper instead of starting with code, dataviz software, and screens? For this workshop, data is our model on the plinth, and we'll be taking techniques from the world of art and design and applying them to data visualization.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore how starting with sketching can offer various starting points for creating custom visualization methods, and learn how experimentation with mark-making and materials testing can be deployed to communicate information in new ways. By the end of this workshop, you'll both better understand the custom data visualizations design process and also have access to a variety of off-screen creative strategies for working with data and shaping its aesthetic (even if you move onto your computer / into code at a later point!)\n\nThe first half of the workshop will be a mix of lectures discussing dataviz basics through the lens of drawing combined with fast-paced creative exercises where participants work individually to sketch data offscreen using black crayon. Next, using a shared class dataset, attendees will work individually to create a custom visualization method and then draw their final visualization.\n\nwww.ISVIS.org", "title-for-yt": "ISVIS2022: Dataviz Drawing Class: Retrospective  / Stefanie Posavec"}
