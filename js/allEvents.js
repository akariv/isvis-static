A computational text analysis of audience comments shows that the Upshot facilitates the expression of analytical thinking and civility.

What\u2019s worse, these effects on our only home will last for generations; species take centuries to recover and greenhouse emissions even longer to disperse, not to mention the discarded (both literally and figuratively) nuclear waste that we have, and continue, to generate in our search for cleaner energy and bigger weapons.\n\nTherefore, the indelible impact of humanity raises questions beyond the practical, beyond the here and now; simply put, this impact raises the question: \u201chow do we tell our children\u2019s children\u2019s children (and further) that we suck?\u201d Many of our decisions will continue to haunt the planet, and our offspring, for potentially hundreds of thousands of years. If we cannot reverse these decisions, can we at least warn those who are to come after us? Sometimes, this warning will be nothing more than \u201cwell, sorry\u201d but in other cases, such as the aforementioned nuclear one, this warning might save lives. Indeed, it might save all of humanity.\n\nOf course the question of whether we should issue these warnings is pretty simple; most people will answer in the positive, bar perhaps some especially pernicious types of nihilists. But the question of how to issue this warning is far more complex. Not only do physical objects erode with the passage of years but so does language. Meanings change, words are lost, entire lexicons fade into obscurity. What\u2019s more, the concepts we are trying to communicate here are very subtle: fear, anxiety, concern, danger, death, illness, and more.\n\nThe best approach we might have open to us is the symbol. While even the more \u201cprimal\u201d languages of symbol, pictograph or chart lose their communicative potency, they do so much more slowly than the written word and contain a potential to communicate with humans on a more fundamental level, perhaps \u201crolling back\u201d some of the chronological gaps between us and our distant offspring.Thus, the question of how to talk to the future and warn them about the dangers we have left behind us strays from the realms of the written and into the realms of visualization.\n\nWhen attempting to visualize these dangers, fears, and warnings to the future, what types of symbols are used? How is data like material half-life, construction methods, environmental damages and risks, potential illness, and other such metrics communicated to people who might not have the underlying science to grasp them? What are the assumptions, politics, and limitations under which such work is undertaken and what do they expose about what we see as the future now and, of course, about the present which is attempting to communicate?

Destabilised Common Grounds is a participatory installation and workshop that utilise senses, information and technological elements to reveal the wisdom of moss and discuss the triangular relationship between human-nature-technology. \nIn this short talk I will present the project and discuss how we may use new forms of interaction and integrate living organisms into gamified feedback loops to facilitate the understanding of complex systems and the relationship between society and ecology.\nBy exploring moss colonies as uncompetitive, slow and resilient entities, This project is aiming to be a catalyst for discussion and activism while exposing the tensions between competition and ecological balance. The installation is designed as a game, where a moss rug acts as a playing board. Each player gets a territory of moss. Their goal is to keep it the greenest and most prosperous area. During the game, the players influence the climate of the moss using water spray, hot air and manipulating the rug\u2019s topography. Two projections visualise the moss's reaction in real-time, one through a macro-lens view and another through a red filter emphasising the dry and vulnerable areas. As the game progresses, the participants would discover how their actions affect the moss\u2019s condition. Would they change the course of the game and collaborate to balance the moss rug? \nThis project communicates scientific and ecological information through experience and visualisation to mediate the intangibility of environmental stewardship. Destabilised Common Grounds was developed during my MA at The Royal College of Art. It was exhibited at Menier Gallery, London, July 2021.

Data visualization is a go-to approach because it leverages our natural abilities as humans to see trends, spot patterns, and identify outliers. A good visualization amplifies cognition and improves decision making.  This works very well for those who can see. \n\nSo the question is this: How do we represent data in a way that provides the same value to everyone, regardless of ability? As a co-author of Material Design\u2019s Data Visualization Guidelines, I\u2019ll reframe Google\u2019s six principles for data visualization and outline how we\u2019re applying them at scale to create more inclusive and accessible representations of data that provide insights for everyone. \n\nKey Takeaways: \nHow might accessibility standards empower design rather than constraining it. \nHow might we create multi sensory data experiences that provide value and insights the same way a chart provides insights to a sighted person. \nHow do we scale our work in data accessibility in large organizations? \n", "authorSocial": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenteisenhuth/, https://www.instagram.com/kent.eisenhuth/, https://twitter.com/KentTheHuth,

My aim is to frame digital news maps in this context as constituting a visual discourse, one with a set of internal operating rules and influences evident as visual signifiers. Digital news-driven maps are subject to rapid change, not only in what they show but how they show it. In the detailed attention paid to representations on social media this has not gone unnoticed. The war in Ukraine has been the subject of intense media coverage all over the world not least in the form of daily, and sometimes hourly, updated maps of the battle space. These maps are available for consumers of online digital news to track changes in troop positions, movements of materiel and people, acts of aggression and defense, and updates to the area of territory claimed and liberated. They are powerful signifiers of attrition, resistance, and domination, as well as abstract representations of a bitterly contested ground truth. This talk will include examples from current news and media outlets and focus on the signifiers at play in digital news maps of the Ukraine war, their cultural meanings and wider visual history.

I chose to learn from my observations, and I was determined to search for patterns within the data.

VAVV is a non-profit organization helping Peruvian communities get direct access to clean water. \nWe began this project with two questions: how can we create an empathic and positive story, and how can we truly engage our viewers?\nIn our talk, we would discuss our design process, challenges, outcomes, and upcoming plans, but mostly how we turned an impersonal and scarce dataset into a relatable data story for children. \n\nOne in five children worldwide lacks access to clean water (UNICEF). \u201cNo-water\u201d communities face a high risk of children getting sick, missing school, or meeting life-threatening situations. Yet, how many of us know this or act upon it? \n\nWe created \u2018Mayu\u2019, a mobile-first project, and perhaps the first data-empathy coloring book designed for children. Mayu\u2019s story illustrates the water crisis of seven communities in need in Piura, Peru, and how VAVV changes their lives. This data project aims at stimulating young viewers' empathy so they can reflect on and even comprehend the scale of the global water crisis. \n\nOur major challenge in this project was translating scarce data into a lively visual language and narrative. To achieve this, we generated a library of graphical objects for the data attributes we wanted to present. Then, we brought them together in story-based compositions to communicate specific information about each of the seven communities. Our data and data visualizations live in those explanatory compositions. Another significant challenge was how to create \u2018Mayu\u2019 with a mobile-first approach, which is often overlooked in digital visualizations. \n\n\u2018Mayu\u2019 is a bilingual social campaign in English and Spanish. Children can participate by visiting the website, printing the stories, coloring them, and organizing fundraising activities for their classes, among other things. Mayu\u2019s online visualizations will gradually come to life whenever a campaign is launched for one or more Piura communities, taking on color and movement as they reveal the fundraising progress. \n\n\u201cFrom a distance, it\u2019s easy to forget the dots are people\u201d (Jake Harris).

Coming with no proper background in data manipulation and visualizations, these challenges provided fruitful grounds to learn how to work with data and fit various charts to the takeaway at hand. As I became more confident I aspired for more: trying out new tools, experimenting with color and minimalism, breaking boundaries or further exploring my curiosity in personal projects.\nThe community participation had a propelling effect, providing both the opportunity and the positive feedback to continue. Besides meeting new friends and inspirational people it created a reason to participate as others did so too. Lastly, seeing others' visualizations of the same topics provided an additional perspective to challenges I just faced, learning about other practices and approaches. \nIn this talk I hope to share my personal experience participating in these challenges, share practices I learned and employ today as an analyst and hopefully motivate you to participate in an upcoming challenge.", "authorDesc": "Risk Strategy Analyst at Payoneer, enjoy data analysis and visualizations.", "authorSocial": "https://amitlevinson.com/", "hour": "17:00"}, {"id": "recrKJ2emLkYTUWn3", "createdTime": "2022-04-14T10:41:32.000Z", "eventParent": "(9) Independent visualizations", "title": "Phrasing Nations", "author": "Oded Ben Yehuda", "content": "These days, more than ever, the world is converging, and quite a few nations are finding themselves for the first time, dealing with their existence, and their future survival. Several years ago, as part of a research I made in my MA in London college of Communication, I dealt with the identity of nations and how they perpetuate their existence through language and terminology.\n\nHow language is used as a tool in order to define and perpetuate nations. In my research I found four textual platforms: Declaration of independence, Anthems, Propaganda campaigns, and International code - each, with its use of specific phrases, words and terminology, manage to reflect the existence of the nation. Interestingly, in my research, I found out that each of the platforms also accurately expressed a different branding tool, such as: brand values, moto, logo and message. \n\nIn my lecture, I will give a brief overview of my research, and on the work of collecting and analysing the large data I have received in the first platform I have found: \"Declaration of independence\". Fascinating, after covering 30 different declarations, I found that this document holds exactly the same methodology like any commercial brand book, with three parts: the \"why,\" the \"what,\" and \"how.\" \n\nIn my research, using the official translated document that was provided by the nations, I put together all texts of the different 30 declarations of independence in a professional analytic tool to examine their words. I was curious to know how nations have chosen to define themselves: kingdom, state, country, republic, or land? How many times they used positive or negative words in the document, how did they formulate their goals and aims at the moment of declaration: democracy, freedom, rights, etc? Or what was the ratio between the words war and peace, life and death, or God and blood in the texts. \n\nI have summarized my research in one big and heavy book, that was edited like a magazine with 5 major chapters, and various short sections in between, embedded with statistics and infographics.", "authorDesc": "A graphic designer, brand strategist and a design researcher and journalist", "authorSocial": "http://graphicsandwords.co.il - a new website is coming soon\nhttps://www.instagram.com/graphicsandwords_odedbenyehuda/", "hour": "17:10"}, {"id": "recwKE2Gsm6Wawlq9", "createdTime": "2022-04-14T10:43:35.000Z", "eventParent": "(9) Independent visualizations", "title": "Workshop 3 Retrospective ", "author": "Stefanie Posavec", "content": "[This is a retrospective recap on a workshop given earlier this week.]\n\nData is the raw material from which data visualizations are created.

By the end of this workshop, you'll both better understand the custom data visualizations design process and also have access to a variety of off-screen creative strategies for working with data and shaping its aesthetic (even if you move onto your computer / into code at a later point!)\n\nThe first half of the workshop will be a mix of lectures discussing dataviz basics through the lens of drawing combined with fast-paced creative exercises where participants work individually to sketch data offscreen using black crayon.
