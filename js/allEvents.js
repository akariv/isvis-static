What\u2019s worse, these effects on our only home will last for generations; species take centuries to recover and greenhouse emissions even longer to disperse, not to mention the discarded (both literally and figuratively) nuclear waste that we have, and continue, to generate in our search for cleaner energy and bigger weapons.\n\nTherefore, the indelible impact of humanity raises questions beyond the practical, beyond the here and now; simply put, this impact raises the question: \u201chow do we tell our children\u2019s children\u2019s children (and further) that we suck?\u201d Many of our decisions will continue to haunt the planet, and our offspring, for potentially hundreds of thousands of years. If we cannot reverse these decisions, can we at least warn those who are to come after us? Sometimes, this warning will be nothing more than \u201cwell, sorry\u201d but in other cases, such as the aforementioned nuclear one, this warning might save lives. Indeed, it might save all of humanity.\n\nOf course the question of whether we should issue these warnings is pretty simple; most people will answer in the positive, bar perhaps some especially pernicious types of nihilists. But the question of how to issue this warning is far more complex. Not only do physical objects erode with the passage of years but so does language. Meanings change, words are lost, entire lexicons fade into obscurity. What\u2019s more, the concepts we are trying to communicate here are very subtle: fear, anxiety, concern, danger, death, illness, and more.\n\nThe best approach we might have open to us is the symbol. While even the more \u201cprimal\u201d languages of symbol, pictograph or chart lose their communicative potency, they do so much more slowly than the written word and contain a potential to communicate with humans on a more fundamental level, perhaps \u201crolling back\u201d some of the chronological gaps between us and our distant offspring.Thus, the question of how to talk to the future and warn them about the dangers we have left behind us strays from the realms of the written and into the realms of visualization.\n\nWhen attempting to visualize these dangers, fears, and warnings to the future, what types of symbols are used? How is data like material half-life, construction methods, environmental damages and risks, potential illness, and other such metrics communicated to people who might not have the underlying science to grasp them? What are the assumptions, politics, and limitations under which such work is undertaken and what do they expose about what we see as the future now and, of course, about the present which is attempting to communicate?

Destabilised Common Grounds is a participatory installation and workshop that utilise senses, information and technological elements to reveal the wisdom of moss and discuss the triangular relationship between human-nature-technology. \nIn this short talk I will present the project and discuss how we may use new forms of interaction and integrate living organisms into gamified feedback loops to facilitate the understanding of complex systems and the relationship between society and ecology.\nBy exploring moss colonies as uncompetitive, slow and resilient entities, This project is aiming to be a catalyst for discussion and activism while exposing the tensions between competition and ecological balance. The installation is designed as a game, where a moss rug acts as a playing board. Each player gets a territory of moss. Their goal is to keep it the greenest and most prosperous area. During the game, the players influence the climate of the moss using water spray, hot air and manipulating the rug\u2019s topography. Two projections visualise the moss's reaction in real-time, one through a macro-lens view and another through a red filter emphasising the dry and vulnerable areas. As the game progresses, the participants would discover how their actions affect the moss\u2019s condition. Would they change the course of the game and collaborate to balance the moss rug? \nThis project communicates scientific and ecological information through experience and visualisation to mediate the intangibility of environmental stewardship. Destabilised Common Grounds was developed during my MA at The Royal College of Art. It was exhibited at Menier Gallery, London, July 2021.

Various types of insights require different types of visualizations; and since Mapbox\u2019s interface is based on layers, a multiplicity of layers does not exactly speed up performance.\n\nIn the work progress, we realized that in order to succeed in this task, the map should have its own design system.
