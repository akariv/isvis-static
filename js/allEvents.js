A corpus based on the Upshot data section of the New York Times has been developed in order to examine the real world reactions to visualizations.

The final dataset contains more than seven thousand stories and over one million comments. A computational text analysis of audience comments shows that the Upshot facilitates the expression of analytical thinking and civility. However, there is no indication that it is related to the use of visualizations in the stories. A better understanding of how visualizations play a role in the story may allow them to be employed more effectively.

They are right, of course. But what happens when you have managed to successfully build a super-smart machine learning decisioning system, that is rarely wrong, but now you need to explain HOW it is working to both your end users and your internal teams?\nThis is exactly the challenge that the design team over at Riskified was tasked with. Riskified is an established Israeli-based tech company that helps retailers around the world prevent online fraud and streamline the shopping experience for their customers. In simple words - our system delivers instant decisions about every online purchase - whether the individual who is trying to buy goods is a legitimate shopper or a fraudster using stolen credit card credentials. This is done using a sophisticated AI platform, built on advanced algorithms, which analyzes hundreds of data points relevant to each purchase including the customer\u2019s online activity. While AI allows us to deliver incredibly accurate decisions, it\u2019s not easy to \u201ctranslate\u201d the logic behind the system\u2019s decisions to reasons that humans can comprehend. This challenge prompted Riskified\u2019s Design team to create \u2018The Featurator\u2019 - an advanced data visualization tool that allows the end user to see what were the underlying reasons for the system\u2019s decisions regarding each transaction. The creation process was complex and required some programming. Today, the Featurator delivers true business value and is widely used on a daily basis by people across teams.\nIn this short presentation, I will describe the work process and the thinking behind this data visualization tool. I will share examples of the various steps we went through until we managed to achieve the desired result. I think it is a good example of how Design teams can deliver significant value and help streamline business processes with data visualization tools. \"", "authorDesc": "Tom Reznikov: Head of Design @ Riskified, Problem-Solving Addict.

Various types of insights require different types of visualizations; and since Mapbox\u2019s interface is based on layers, a multiplicity of layers does not exactly speed up performance.\n\nIn the work progress, we realized that in order to succeed in this task, the map should have its own design system. Therefore, we charted the various types of visualizations we use, and the kinds of elements we need (line, polygon, etc.).\n\nBy doing that, we managed to reduce the number of layers significantly. Each layer, according to its metadata, was defined by data conditions and style expressions, thus creating various appearances, and a set of atoms and molecules which allow us to stay consistent.\n\nAt ISVIS, I'll demonstrate our map design workflow: from receiving the data, through its fabrication into design components.
